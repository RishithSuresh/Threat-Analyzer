This folder contains the original React + TypeScript source for the Threat-Analyzer project.

It was moved here to preserve the prototype while the repository is converted to a static HTML/CSS/JS site.

Files archived include the entire `src/` directory (components, pages, styles) and TypeScript artifacts.

If you need to restore the React app, move the contents back to the `src/` folder and reinstall dependencies.
